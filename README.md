# Dotfiles

My Arch + i3 setup. Minimal for low end devices. This is my first ever rice so there might be a few errors please stand by!!

## What I'm Using

- **OS:** Arch Linux
- **WM:** i3-gaps
- **Bar:** Polybar  
- **Terminal:** Alacritty
- **Editor:** VSCode
- **Launcher:** Rofi
- **Compositor:** Picom
- **File Manager:** Thunar
- **Browser:** Brave
- **Media Player:** MPV

## Features

- Colors update from wallpaper
- Transparent with blur (on alacritty, thunar and VS Code)
- Custom VSCode theme (transparent and syntax highlighting. Nothing much)
- Optimized for low-end hardware (I personally have a laptop with an intel i3 4030u and 4gb ddr3 ram and it runs quite well on it.)
- All configs and fonts included

## Wallpaper

I already provided a black and white wallpaper. Feel free to change it.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
wal -i wallpapers/cat.jpg
